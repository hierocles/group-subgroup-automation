# group-subgroup-automation
Discourse Automation plugin to manage parent group & subgroup relations. Requires [hierocles/discourse-automation](https://github.com/hierocles/discourse-automation) fork in order to work, as the main [discourse/discourse-automation](https://github.com/discourse-automation) plugin lacks the necessary Groups field component.

# Thanks
Big thanks to @scossar's [discourse-automation example](https://github.com/scossar/automation-script-example) for the jumping-off point.
